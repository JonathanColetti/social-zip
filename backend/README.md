# IMPORTANT INFO

There exists a lot I would do better (design, code, test) wise. This was written (October 13th 2023) and thus throughout my experience I have learned alot. If I find the time I would love to refactor this code and system. However, it is still a good showcase of work!

# How to run

You need to generate the certs directory. Which contains the files

```
apple_key.p8
cert.pem
chain.pem
fullchain.pem
privkey.pem
```
For obvious reasons I will not provide these files
