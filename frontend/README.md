# IMPORTANT INFO

There exists a lot I would do better (design, code, test) wise. This was written (October 13th 2023) and thus throughout my experience I have learned alot. If I find the time I would love to refactor this code. However, it is still a good showcase of work!

# What I would do better


## Testing

I would create test cases based on Kent C. Dodds principles 

- [Nesting](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing)
- [Common mistakes with React Testing Library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)

## Code
- Move styles to seperate files
- Remove all uses of `any` unless absolutely necessary
